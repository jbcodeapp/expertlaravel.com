So, let's follow the step-by-step guide to install Tailwind CSS in a Laravel application.

## 1) Install Tailwind CSS using npm

In this step, I will provide you with a list of steps using npm commands. Let's follow it.

**Step 1: Install Laravel**

If you haven't already set up a Laravel application, you can run the following command to get a fresh Laravel app:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

**Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS**

Let's install Tailwind CSS along with its dependencies and create a tailwind.config.js file. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init
```

**Step 3: Configure Template Path**

Open the tailwind.config.js file and add file paths as shown below:

```blade
module.exports = {
content: [
"./resources/**/*.blade.php",
"./resources/**/*.js",
"./resources/**/*.vue",
],
theme: {
extend: {},
},
plugins: [],
}
```

**Step 4: Add Tailwind with Laravel Mix**

Open the webpack.mix.js file and add the following lines:

```php
const mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")
.postCss("resources/css/app.css", "public/css", [require("tailwindcss")]);
Step 5: Add Tailwind CSS in app.css file

Open the resources/css/app.css file and add the following lines:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**Step 6: Install npm and Build**

Run the following commands to install npm dependencies and build the assets:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run watch
```

**Step 7: Use Tailwind CSS in App**

Now, you can use Tailwind CSS classes in your Blade files as shown below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container mx-auto px-10">
      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">How to Install Tailwind CSS in Laravel</h1>
