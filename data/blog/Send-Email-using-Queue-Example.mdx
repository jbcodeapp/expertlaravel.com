## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to send emails using a queue in Laravel. We will guide you through the step-by-step process of sending emails with a queue in Laravel. We will also provide an example of sending an email using a queue. By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement sending emails in the background, which can improve user experience and performance for tasks like email verification or sending invoices.

## Step 1: Install Laravel

If you don't already have a Laravel app, you can create one using the following command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

## Step 2: Create Mail Class with Configuration

To begin, let's create an email for testing using the Laravel Mail facade. Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:mail SendEmailTest
```

This will generate a new folder named "Mail" in the app directory, containing the `SendEmailTest.php` file. Replace the contents of this file with the following code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class SendEmailTest extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public function __construct()
    {
    }

    public function build()
    {
        return $this->view('emails.test');
    }
}

```

Next, create the email view using a Blade file. Create a file named `test.blade.php` in the `resources/views/emails/` directory with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Laravel Send Email using Queue Example</title>
</head>

<body>
    <center>
        <h2 ">
            <a style="padding: 23px;background: #8f8a8aa1; href="https://jbcodeapp.com">Visit Our Website :
            jbcodeapp.com</a>
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2><b>Hello, Learner</b> This is Test Message</h2>
    </center>

</body>

</html>
```

After configuring the view file, set up the email configuration in the `.env` file:

```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

## Step 3: Queue Configuration

Configure the queue driver by setting the `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in the `.env` file:

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Generate and migrate the queue database tables using the following commands:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 4: Create Queue Job

Create a queue job using the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:job SendEmailJob
```

This will generate the `SendEmailJob.php` file in the `Jobs` directory. Replace its contents with the following code:

```php
namespace App\Jobs;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeUnique;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use App\Mail\SendEmailTest;
use Mail;

class SendEmailJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    protected $details;

    public function __construct($details)
    {
        $this->details = $details;
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        $email = new SendEmailTest();
        Mail::to($this->details['email'])->send($email);
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Test Queue Job

Create a route in the `routes/web.php` file to test the created queue:

```php
Route::get('email-test', function () {
    $details['email'] = 'your_email@gmail.com';
    dispatch(new App\Jobs\SendEmailJob($details));
    dd('done');
});
```

To see the queue process, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```
