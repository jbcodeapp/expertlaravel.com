## Introduction

[React](https://react.dev/) 18 has landed, introducing groundbreaking features and improvements that redefine the developer experience. Let's delve into the key highlights and unravel the steps for a smooth upgrade to this version.

## 1. Concurrent Rendering

React 18 takes a giant leap with Concurrent Rendering, enhancing the user experience by preparing multiple UI versions simultaneously. This behind-the-scenes magic ensures more responsive applications, making updates in the background without hindering the main thread.

### How it Works:

- Rendering becomes interruptible, enabling updates to start, pause, and resume seamlessly.
- UI consistency is maintained even if a render is interrupted, ensuring a polished user experience.
- Concurrency is opt-in, allowing a gradual integration of concurrent features at your own pace.

## 2. Automatic Batching

- React 18 introduces Automatic Batching, grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render for improved performance. This includes updates within promises, timeouts, and native event handlers.

## 3. Transitions

- The concept of Transitions is introduced to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates. React 18 provides the startTransition API, allowing developers to inform React about non-urgent updates, optimizing the handling of UI changes.

## 4. Suspense in Data Frameworks

- React 18 enables the use of Suspense for data fetching in frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Hydrogen, or [Remix](https://remix.run/). This marks a significant stride toward a seamless integration of Suspense across various aspects of application architecture.

## 5. Server Components (Experimental)

- While still in development, Server Components aim to revolutionize server and client-side capabilities for enhanced performance. This aligns with concurrent features like Suspense and streaming server rendering.

## 6. New Hooks

- **useId**: Generates unique IDs for components, crucial for accessibility integration.
- **useTransition** and startTransition: Manage urgent and non-urgent updates, supporting concurrent rendering.
- **useDeferredValue**: Defers re-rendering of non-urgent parts of the tree.
- **useSyncExternalStore**: Facilitates concurrent reads in external stores, designed for library use.

## 7. New Strict Mode Behaviors

- Strict Mode introduces checks for components to handle unmounting and remounting. This optimizes performance by allowing React to add and remove UI sections while preserving state.

## 8. Updated Rendering APIs

- React 18 brings changes to rendering APIs on both the client and server sides, providing more control and flexibility.

## 9. Suspense Enhancements

- Suspense now works on the server and is more powerful with concurrent rendering features, especially when combined with transitions.

## 10. How to Upgrade

The upgrade journey involves two steps:

### Step 1: Install React 18

Update React and React DOM to the latest version:

```bash
npm i react@latest react-dom@latest
```

### Step 2: Use the New Root API

Modify the rendering code to utilize React 18's concurrent features:

```javascript
// Before
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// After
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

This upgrade is straightforward, unlocking React 18's potential for enhanced performance. Embrace the future of React development with these cutting-edge features!
