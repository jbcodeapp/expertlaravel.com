## Introduction

## App Directory

The app directory in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 11 has been significantly reduced by moving nine middleware to the framework.
[Middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/middleware) changes are now managed through the `bootstrap/app.php` file, providing a leaner configuration style.

```PHP
return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withProviders()
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        // Add custom middleware
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        // Handle exceptions
    })
    ->create();
```

## Config Directory

The config directory is now empty, with configuration options moved to the `.env.example` file.

Configuration files can be published and customized using the `config:publish` command.

```command
php artisan config:publish database
php artisan config:publish logging
# Or publish all of them
php artisan config:publish
```

## Database Directory

The database directory remains similar, but migration filenames are now ordered rather than date-based.

The `create_personal_access_tokens.php` migration file is no longer included by default.

## Routes Directory

The routes directory includes only web.php and console.php files.
Additional functionalities like API and broadcasting routes can be installed using artisan commands.

```command
php artisan install:api
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

## Test Directory

- The test directory no longer includes the CreatesApplication trait in Laravel 11, as it's provided in the base TestCase.

## Compatibility

- Existing Laravel 10 applications don't need structural changes to upgrade to Laravel 11.

- The new structure is applicable only to fresh Laravel 11 installations.

## Quick summary

Laravel 11 introduces significant enhancements to directory structures, streamlining the app, config, database, routes, and test directories. Notable changes include middleware management in `bootstrap/app.php`, an empty config directory with options moved to .env.example, ordered migration filenames, simplified routes directory, and a refined test directory without the CreatesApplication trait.
