# Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating a simple web application using React that redirects users to another page after a 5-second delay. This can be handy for scenarios where you want to guide users to a different part of your website or to an external link.

# Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

## Step 1: Set Up Your React App

If you haven't already created a React app, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app page-redirect-demo
```

This will create a new React app with the name "page-redirect-demo."

## Step 2: Create the App Component

Next, open the `src/App.js` file and replace its contents with the following code:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [redirecting, setRedirecting] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setRedirecting(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.href = 'https://jbcodeapp.com';
    }, 5000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Redirecting to Another Page in 5 Seconds with jQuery</h1>
      {redirecting ? (
        <p>Redirecting soon....</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Click to redirect</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code, we define a React functional component named App. It contains a state variable redirecting, which we'll use to control the display of a button and a message. When the button is clicked, the handleClick function sets redirecting to true and then uses setTimeout to redirect the user to `https://jbcodeapp.com` after a 5-second delay.

## Step 3: Run Your React App

Now, go back to your terminal and navigate to your project folder (page-redirect-demo). Start your React app by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Your app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. Open a web browser and go to this URL.

## Step 4: Test the Redirect

You should see the message "Redirecting to Another Page in 5 Seconds with React" and a button that says "Click to redirect." Click the button, and after a 5-second delay, you will be redirected to https://jbcodeapp.com.
