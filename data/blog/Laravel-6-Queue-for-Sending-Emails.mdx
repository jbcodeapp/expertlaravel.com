## Learn How to Send Emails Using Queue in Laravel

### Hello Developers,

Welcome to this tutorial where we'll delve into using queues in Laravel 7/6 to optimize the process of sending emails. We'll explore how to send emails asynchronously using Laravel's built-in queue system. By utilizing queues, you can improve user experience by minimizing loading times for tasks like sending emails or processing payments. In this tutorial, we'll start from scratch and create a basic example of sending emails using a queue in Laravel 7/6.

In this tutorial, we'll create a basic example of sending emails using a queue in Laravel 7/6. We'll set up the Laravel project, create a mail template, configure the email settings, define a queue job, and finally test the queue by sending an email.

## Step 1: Set Up Laravel 6

To begin, let's set up a fresh Laravel 6 project using the following command:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog
```

## Step 2: Create a Mail Template

We'll start by creating a simple email template that we'll later use in our queue job. Run the command to generate a new mail class:

```bash
php artisan make:mail SendEmailTest
```

This will create a new mail class `SendEmailTest` under the `app/Mail` directory. Replace the content of the generated `SendEmailTest.php` file with the following code:

```php
// app/Mail/SendEmailTest.php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class SendEmailTest extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public function __construct()
    {
        //
    }

    public function build()
    {
        return $this->view('emails.test');
    }
}
```

Next, create the email view file `test.blade.php` under the `resources/views/emails` directory and use the following code:

```html
<!-- resources/views/emails/test.blade.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>How to Send Mail Using Queue in Laravel 6?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <center>
      <h2 style="padding: 23px;background: #b3deb8a1;border-bottom: 6px green solid;">
        <a href="https://jbcodeapp.com">Visit Our Website : jbcodeapp.com</a>
      </h2>
    </center>

    <p>Hi, Sir</p>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
      labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco
      laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
      voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
      non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
    </p>

    <strong>Thank you Sir. :)</strong>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 3: Configure the Queue

Open the `.env` file and set the queue driver to "database":

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Generate the migration for the queue tables:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
```

Run the migration to create the queue tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 4: Create a Queue Job

Generate a new queue job using the command:

```bash
php artisan make:job SendEmailJob
```

Open the generated `SendEmailJob.php` file located in the `app/Jobs` directory and replace its content with the following code:

```php
// app/Jobs/SendEmailJob.php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use App\Mail\SendEmailTest;
use Mail;

class SendEmailJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    protected $details;

    public function __construct($details)
    {
        $this->details = $details;
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        $email = new SendEmailTest();
        Mail::to($this->details['email'])->send($email);
    }
}

```

## Step 5: Test the Queue Job

Let's create a route to test the email queue. In your `routes/web.php` file, add the following code:

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::get('email-test', function () {

    $details['email'] = 'your_email@gmail.com';

    dispatch(new App\Jobs\SendEmailJob($details));

    dd('done');
});
```

Start the queue worker to process the queued jobs:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

You can now run your Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Access the following link in your browser to initiate the email queue test:

http://localhost:8000/email-test
