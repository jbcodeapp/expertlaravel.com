## Introduction

Chai, a robust BDD/TDD assertion library for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and browsers, seamlessly integrates with various JavaScript testing frameworks. In this blog post, we'll delve into the 'what' and 'why' behind Chai, explore its testing styles, and showcase some essential plugins along with code examples to enhance your testing experience.

## What is Chai?

[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) stands as a powerful assertion library providing developers with a range of expressive BDD and TDD styles for testing their JavaScript code. It offers a delightful experience by pairing well with any JavaScript testing framework, making it a popular choice in the developer community [Google Group,](https://groups.google.com/g/chaijs?pli=1).

## Why Choose Chai?

Chai's versatility and ease of integration with different testing frameworks make it a preferred choice for developers. Whether you prefer BDD or TDD, Chai's expressive syntax and readable styles cater to different developer preferences. Let's dive into the various testing styles provided by Chai.

## Usage

Chai supports three testing styles: assert, expect, and should. Choose the one that aligns with your preferred coding style:

### Importing Styles

```jsx
import { assert } from 'chai'; // Assert style
import { expect } from 'chai'; // Expect style
import { should } from 'chai'; // Should style
```

### Registering Globally

```jsx
import 'chai/register-assert'; // Assert style
import 'chai/register-expect'; // Expect style
import 'chai/register-should'; // Should style
```

### Local Variables

```jsx
import { assert } from 'chai'; // Assert style
import { expect, use } from 'chai'; // Expect style with local variables
import { should } from 'chai'; // Should style with modification of `Object.prototype`
should(); // Modifies `Object.prototype`
```

## Testing Styles with Full Code Examples

### 1. **Should Style**:

Chai's [should style](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should) provides a chain-capable BDD interface for writing expressive and readable tests. Here's an example:

```jsx
var assert = require('chai').assert,
  myVar = 'bar',
  beverages = { coffee: ['latte', 'espresso', 'cappuccino'] };

assert.typeOf(myVar, 'string'); // without optional message
assert.typeOf(myVar, 'string', 'myVar is a string'); // with optional message
assert.equal(myVar, 'bar', 'myVar equal `bar`');
assert.lengthOf(myVar, 3, 'myVar`s value has a length of 3');
assert.lengthOf(beverages.coffee, 3, 'beverages has 3 types of coffee');
```

### 2. **Expect Style**:

The [expect style](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#expect), using the expect function, offers a clean and concise syntax for assertions. Here's an example:

```jsx
var expect = require('chai').expect,
  myVar = 'bar',
  beverages = { coffee: ['latte', 'espresso', 'cappuccino'] };

expect(myVar).to.be.a('string');
expect(myVar).to.equal('bar');
expect(myVar).to.have.lengthOf(3);
expect(beverages).to.have.property('coffee').with.lengthOf(3);
```

### 3. **Assert Style**:

For developers who prefer a more classical feel, Chai provides an [assert style](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assert) with the assert object. Here's an example:

```jsx
var assert = require('chai').assert,
  myVar = 'bar',
  beverages = { coffee: ['latte', 'espresso', 'cappuccino'] };

assert.typeOf(myVar, 'string'); // without optional message
assert.typeOf(myVar, 'string', 'myVar is a string'); // with optional message
assert.equal(myVar, 'bar', 'myVar equal `bar`');
assert.lengthOf(myVar, 3, 'myVar`s value has a length of 3');
assert.lengthOf(beverages.coffee, 3, 'beverages has 3 types of coffee');
```

## Essential Chai Plugins

### Chai Assertion Library plugins

### 1. chai-webdriver

[Chai-webdriver](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-webdriver/) is a plugin that provides selenium-webdriver sugar for the Chai assertion library, enabling expressive integration tests for both Node.js and browser environments. It allows you to make assertions related to DOM elements, such as checking visibility, text content, and more.

- Install npm command

```bash
npm install chai-webdriver
```

- How to Use:

```jsx
// Setup (as mentioned in the documentation)
var sw = require('selenium-webdriver');
var driver = new sw.Builder().withCapabilities(sw.Capabilities.chrome()).build();
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiWebdriver = require('chai-webdriver');
chai.use(chaiWebdriver(driver));

// Example Assertion
driver.get('http://example.com');
chai.expect('.example-element').dom.to.be.visible();
```

### 2. chai-dom-eql

[Chai-dom-eql](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-dom/) extends Chai with deep equality assertions specifically designed for the DOM. It proves useful when comparing complex DOM structures in your tests.

- Install npm command

```bash
npm install chai-dom-eql
```

- How to Use:

```jsx
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiDomEql = require('chai-dom-eql');
chai.use(chaiDomEql);

// Example Assertion
chai.expect(actualDOM).to.dom.eql(expectedDOM);
```

### 3. chai-http

[Chai-http](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-http/) is a plugin that extends Chai for HTTP assertion testing. It allows you to make HTTP requests and assert their responses, making it suitable for testing APIs and server-side functionality.

- Install npm command

```bash
npm install chai-http
```

- How to Use:

```jsx
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
chai.use(chaiHttp);

// Example HTTP Request Assertion
chai
  .request('http://api.example.com')
  .get('/resource')
  .end((err, res) => {
    chai.expect(res).to.have.status(200);
  });
```

### 4. chai-enzyme

[Chai-enzyme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-enzyme) is an integration for Chai with Enzyme, a testing utility for React components. It provides assertions tailored for testing React component outputs.

- Install npm command

```bash
npm install chai-enzyme
```

- How to Use:

```
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiEnzyme = require('chai-enzyme');
chai.use(chaiEnzyme());

// Example React Component Assertion
const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
chai.expect(wrapper).to.have.tagName('div');
```

### 5. chai-json-schema

[Chai-json-schema](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-json-schema/) allows Chai to assert JSON structures against JSON schemas, making it particularly useful for testing APIs and validating data formats.

- Install npm command

```bash
npm install chai-json-schema
```

- How to Use:

```jsx
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiJsonSchema = require('chai-json-schema');
chai.use(chaiJsonSchema);

// Example JSON Schema Assertion
chai.expect(myData).to.be.jsonSchema(myJsonSchema);
```

// Your React component
const MyComponent = ({ message }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{message}</h1>
  </div>
);

// Your test file
import { expect } from 'chai';
import chaiEnzyme from 'chai-enzyme';
import chaiReact from 'chai-react';
import chaiJsx from 'chai-jsx';

// Apply Chai plugins
chai.use(chaiEnzyme());
chai.use(chaiReact);
chai.use(chaiJsx);
chai.use(chaiEnzymeMatchers);
chai.use(chaiReactRendered);

// Test the React component
describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders with the correct message', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent message="Hello, Chai!" />);

    // Chai assertions using the installed plugins
    expect(wrapper).to.have.text('Hello, Chai!'); // chai-enzyme
    expect(wrapper).to.containReact(<h1>Hello, Chai!</h1>); // chai-react
    expect(wrapper.find('h1')).to.have.text('Hello, Chai!'); // chai-jsx
    expect(wrapper).to.have.tagName('div'); // chai-enzyme-matchers
    expect(wrapper).to.be.rendered.withProps({ message: 'Hello, Chai!' }); // chai-react-rendered
  });
});
```
