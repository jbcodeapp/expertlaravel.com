## Introduction

Laravel 11 is introducing a powerful memoization helper, once(), designed to ensure consistent results when calling an object method. Inspired by a tweet from Taylor Otwell and previously developed as a package by [Spatie](https://spatie.be/), this unique helper is now becoming a core feature in Laravel 11.

Let's dive into a practical example using the new [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 11 make:class Artisan command to create a class called OnceDemo. This class contains two methods, uuid() and uuidOnce(), demonstrating the power of the once() helper.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface;

class OnceDemo
{
    /**
     * Method generating UUID using Laravel's Str::uuid()
     *
     * @return UuidInterface
     */
    public function uuid(): UuidInterface
    {
        return Str::uuid();
    }

    /**
     * Method using the once() helper to ensure a consistent result
     *
     * @return UuidInterface
     */
    public function uuidOnce(): UuidInterface
    {
        return once(fn (): UuidInterface => $this->uuid());
    }
}

?>

```

## Difference in Behavior:

To illustrate the difference in behavior, consider the following code snippets. The first snippet calls the uuid() method directly, producing a new UUID with each iteration:

```php
$demo = new App\OnceDemo;
foreach (range(1, 5) as $_) {
    echo $demo->uuid() . "\n";
}
```

In contrast, using the uuidOnce() method with the once() helper ensures the same result in each iteration:

```php
$demo = new App\OnceDemo;
foreach (range(1, 5) as $_) {
    echo $demo->uuidOnce() . "\n";
}
```

## Clearing Memoization in Tests:

The blog post emphasizes the importance of clearing the memoization function after each test to maintain a clean state. Laravel simplifies this process using the Once::flush() method in the base TestCase class.

## Quick summary

Laravel 11 introduces the once() helper, a potent memoization tool ensuring reliable results when calling an object method. This feature, inspired by a tweet from Taylor Otwell and previously a package by [Spatie](https://spatie.be/), is now a core part of Laravel. The once() helper is showcased in a practical example with the make:class Artisan command to create a class called OnceDemo. This class demonstrates the power of once() through methods like uuid() and uuidOnce().
