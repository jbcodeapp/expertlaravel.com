# **Node.js Folder Creation: Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners**

Node.js is a versatile and powerful runtime environment for server-side applications, and it's also handy for performing various file system operations, such as creating multiple folders. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of creating multiple folders using Node.js.

## **Prerequisites:**

Before you get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### **Step 1: Set Up a New Node.js Project**

If you don't already have a Node.js project, you can create one by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Node.js project using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   This command will guide you through the setup process and create a `package.json` file for your project.

### **Step 2: Utilize the Built-In `fs` Module**

Node.js comes with a built-in `fs` (File System) module, so there's no need to install any additional packages for this task.

### **Step 3: Write the JavaScript Code**

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `createFolders.js`) in your project directory to write the code for creating multiple folders. Here's an example script to create three folders: `folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3`.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const foldersToCreate = ['folder1', 'folder2', 'folder3', 'folder4'];

foldersToCreate.forEach((folder) => {
  fs.mkdir(folder, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(`Error creating ${folder}: ${err.message}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${folder} created successfully.`);
    }
  });
});
```

This script imports the `fs` module, defines an array of folder names to create, and uses a `forEach` loop to create each folder.If there is any error during folder creation, it will be logged to the console.

### **Step 4: Run the Node.js Script**

To execute your Node.js script, open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
node createFolders.js
```

This will execute the script, and you should see output indicating whether each folder was created successfully or if there was an error.

### **Step 5: Verify the Created Folders**

Check your project directory, and you should find the three folders (`folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3`) created and ready for use.

Congratulations! You've successfully created multiple folders using Node.js. You can customize the script to create different folders or a different number of folders based on your specific needs.

### Conclusion

Node.js provides a flexible environment for working with files and directories, making it a valuable tool for various tasks, including folder creation. Enjoy exploring the possibilities that Node.js offers!
