# Learn React.js Step by Step

[React.js](https://react.dev/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through learning React.js from the ground up.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a basic understanding of:

- HTML
- CSS
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) fundamentals

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

The first step is to set up your development environment:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.
2. Use `npm` to install a code editor of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Step 2: Creating Your First React App

Let's create a new React app using Create React App:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the command: `npx create-react-app my-first-app`
3. Navigate to the app directory: `cd my-first-app`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Step 3: Understanding Components

React is all about components. Learn about:

- Functional Components
- Class Components

## Step 4: JSX - JavaScript XML

Understand JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

## Step 5: Props and State

Learn about props for passing data to components and state for managing component-specific data:

```jsx
// Props
<Header title="Welcome to My App" />;

// State
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Handling Events

Explore event handling in React:

```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Lifecycle Methods

Understand the lifecycle of a React component and use lifecycle methods:

- `componentDidMount`
- `componentDidUpdate`
- `componentWillUnmount`

## Step 8: Building a Simple App

Put your knowledge into practice by building a simple to-do list app:

- Create components: TodoApp, TodoList, TodoItem
- Manage state for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Step 9: Working with Hooks

Introduce hooks, which allow you to use state and other React features in functional components:

- [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)
- [useEffect](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
- [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)

## Step 10: Routing with React Router

Learn how to add routing to your app using React Router:

1. Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom`
2. Set up routes and navigation.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've taken the journey to learn React.js step by step. By now, you should have a solid understanding of React fundamentals and be ready to build more complex applications.

Remember, practice is key to mastering React. Keep experimenting, building projects, and exploring more advanced topics to become a proficient React developer.
