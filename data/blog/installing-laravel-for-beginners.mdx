# A Beginner's Guide to Installing Laravel: Step-by-Step

Are you excited to venture into web development and craft powerful web applications? Laravel, one of the most sought-after PHP frameworks, is a fantastic starting point for your journey. In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll accompany you through the step-by-step procedure of installing Laravel, enabling you to embark on the creation of remarkable web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we initiate the installation process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. [PHP](https://www.php.net/) : [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) necessitates `PHP 7.4` or a higher version. You can verify your PHP version by executing `php -v` in your command line.

2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/): Composer is a valuable dependency management tool for PHP. You can easily download and install it from getcomposer.org.

3. A Web Server: A web server, such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), is essential. If you're just starting out, you can utilize Laravel's built-in development server for testing.

## Step 1: Install Composer

If you haven't already installed Composer, head over to https://getcomposer.org. Choose the installer that matches your operating system and follow the installation instructions for your specific OS.

To confirm that Composer is correctly installed, open your command line and run:

```sh
composer --version
```

You should see Composer's version information displayed if the installation was successful.

## Step 2: Install Laravel Installer

Laravel offers a handy tool known as the Laravel Installer, which simplifies the process of creating Laravel applications. To install it, execute the following command:

```sh
composer global require laravel/installer
```

## Step 3: Create a New Laravel Project

Now that you have the Laravel Installer, you can initiate a new Laravel project with a single command. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```sh
laravel new project-name
```

Replace project-name with your preferred project name.

## Step 4: Serve Your Application

Laravel comes equipped with a built-in development server, making the initial setup a [breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze). Navigate to your project's directory:

```sh
cd project-name
```

Then, run the following command to launch the development server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Your Laravel application is now accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can access it through your web browser.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Laravel and initiated your first Laravel project. With Laravel's elegant and intuitive syntax, you're well on your way to crafting dynamic web applications. Take your time to explore Laravel's comprehensive documentation, and don't hesitate to experiment and learn.
