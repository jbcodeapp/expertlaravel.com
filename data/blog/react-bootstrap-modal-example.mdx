# React Bootstrap Modal Popup Example

Introduction: In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a modal popup in a React application using Bootstrap. We'll take you through the process step by step.

If you haven't checked [how to create a React app]() yet, you can find a guide on this link: '[REACTJS]().' It's important to learn the basics before you start.

Overview: In this tutorial, we'll implement a modal popup in a React application using Bootstrap. We'll guide you through the process of installing the necessary packages and creating the modal step by step.

## Installation:

To get started, you'll need to install Bootstrap using the following npm command:

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

## Importing Bootstrap CSS:

After successfully installing Bootstrap, you should import the Bootstrap CSS in your `src/index.js` file like this:

```bash
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

## Creating the Modal Popup:

In your `src/App.js` file, we will write code to create a simple Bootstrap 4 modal popup using the `react-bootstrap` library. Here's the code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Modal } from 'react-bootstrap';

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const handleClose = () => setShow(false);
  const handleShow = () => setShow(true);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>React Bootstrap Modal Example</h1>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={handleShow}>
        Open Demo Model
      </Button>
      <Modal size="lg" show={show} onHide={handleClose}>
        <Modal.Header closeButton>
          <Modal.Title>React Bootstrap Modal Example</Modal.Title>
        </Modal.Header>
        <Modal.Body>
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
          been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
          a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        </Modal.Body>
        <Modal.Footer>
          <Button variant="secondary" onClick={handleClose}>
            Close
          </Button>
          <Button variant="primary" onClick={handleClose}>
            Save It!
          </Button>
        </Modal.Footer>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Running the Example: To see the modal in action, you can run your React application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Output :

Running any of these commands will create a folder called `my-app` in your current directory. It contains the initial project structure and installs necessary dependencies. No need for complex configurations â€“ you'll have everything you need.
