## Learn How to Implement Email Notifications in Laravel

**Discover the Art of Sending Email Notifications in Laravel**

## Laravel's notification system

Laravel's notification system is an influential feature within the Laravel PHP framework, enabling seamless communication with users through diverse channels such as email, SMS, Slack, and more. These notifications are defined through dedicated notification classes, which extend the `Illuminate\Notifications\Notification` class. In these classes, you wield the power to customize the content, formatting, and channels through which notifications are transmitted.

The Laravel framework offers an array of built-in channels for diverse notification mediums, including email notifications, database storage, and even broadcasting notifications through web sockets. Additionally, custom channels can be crafted to extend this functionality to various communication platforms.

### Step 1: Laravel Installation

Begin by installing Laravel if you haven't already. Execute the following command to set up a new Laravel app:

```sh
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

### Step 2: Database Migration

Create a new migration to add a 'birthdate' column to the users table using the command:

```sh
php artisan make:migration add_birthdate_column
```

In the generated migration file located at `database/migrations`, include the following code to define the new column:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->date('birthdate')->nullable();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        // Define rollback logic here
    }
};
```

Apply the migration using:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 3: Model Update

Update the User model located at `app/Models/User.php`. Include the 'birthdate' column in the `$fillable` array. Ensure you include the `Notifiable` trait from `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable`:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;

    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
        'birthdate'
    ];

    // Other attributes and methods...
}
```

### Step 4: Creating Notifications

Generate the BirthdayWish notification class using the command:

```sh
php artisan make:notification BirthdayWish
```

This will create a new folder named `Notifications` within the `app` directory. Open the generated `app/Notifications/BirthdayWish.php` file and adjust it as follows:

```php
namespace App\Notifications;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

class BirthdayWish extends Notification
{
    use Queueable;

    private $messages;

    public function __construct($messages)
    {
        $this->messages = $messages;
    }

    public function via(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return ['mail'];
    }

    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
            ->line($this->messages['hi'])
            ->line($this->messages['wish'])
            ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

    public function toArray(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return [
            // Additional data if needed
        ];
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Email Configuration

Configure the email settings including mail driver, host, port, username, password, and other essential details in the `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=mygoogle@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### Step 6: Defining Routes

Define a route for sending notifications to users. Open the `routes/web.php` file and add the following route:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

Route::get('user-notify', [UserController::class, 'index']);
```

### Step 7: Controller Logic

Create a UserController with an index method responsible for triggering the notification. The following code illustrates the logic within `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Models\User;
use App\Notifications\BirthdayWish;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $user = User::find(1);

        $messages["hi"] = "Hey, Happy Birthday {$user->name}";
        $messages["wish"] = "On behalf of the entire company, I wish you a very happy birthday and send you my best wishes for much happiness in your life.";

        $user->notify(new BirthdayWish($messages));

        dd('Notification sent successfully');
    }
}
```

With the above steps completed, your Laravel app is set to go. To run the app, execute the following command and access it through your web browser:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/user-notify` to view the output and observe the email notification in action.
