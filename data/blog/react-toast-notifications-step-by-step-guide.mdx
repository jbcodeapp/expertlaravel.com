## Introduction

Toast notifications are a simple yet effective way to provide feedback to users in a non-intrusive manner in [React.js](https://react.dev/learn) applications. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a basic Toast notification using the popular `react-toastify` library. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed, let's create a new React.js project using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app react-toast-example
cd react-toast-example
npm start
```

## Step 2: Install a Toast Library

There are various libraries available for creating Toast notifications in React. In this example, we'll use the react-toastify library. Install it with npm:

```bash
npm install react-toastify
```

## Step 3: Create a Toast Component

Now, let's create a new component to display Toast notifications. Create a file named Toast.js in your React project:

```javascript
// Toast.js
import React from 'react';
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';

const Toast = () => {
  const showToast = () => {
    toast('This is a Toast notification!', { autoClose: 2000 });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={showToast}>Show Toast</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Toast;
```

In this component, we import the necessary elements from react-toastify and set up a simple button to trigger the Toast notification.

## Step 4: Implement the Toast Component

Now, let's integrate the Toast component into your App.js:

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Toast from './Toast';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Toast Example</h1>
      <Toast />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 5: Style Your Toasts

You have the optionto customize the styling of your Toast notifications by editing the CSS or utilizing the provided classes. For more advanced styling, consider overriding the default styles.

```jsx
const showToast = () => {
  toast('This is a Toast notification!', {
    autoClose: 2000,
    style: { background: 'gray', color: 'white' }, // // Customize the background and text color
  });
};
```

## Step 6: Run Your React App

Start your React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see your React application with the Toast notification in action.

## Step 7: Quick summary

In this step-by-step guide, we've explored the process of creating Toast notifications in React.js using the react-toastify library. These unobtrusive pop-up messages are a valuable addition to any React application, enhancing user experience by providing timely feedback and alerts.

We began by setting up a new React project and installing the react-toastify library. Then, we created a Toast component that allows you to trigger notifications with a simple button click. Along the way, you learned how to customize the appearance and behavior of your Toasts to match your application's design.
