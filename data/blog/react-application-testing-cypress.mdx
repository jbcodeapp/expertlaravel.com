## Introduction

Cypress is a cutting-edge front-end testing tool meticulously crafted for the demands of the modern web. As of its latest version, 13.6.6. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) stands out as a reliable and efficient solution for testing anything that operates within a browser environment. With 551 projects in the npm registry already utilizing Cypress, it has become a trusted choice for developers and QA professionals alike.

Cypress is a testing framework primarily utilized by developers and QA (Quality Assurance) engineers engaged in the construction of web applications that employ contemporary JavaScript frameworks. This versatile tool supports the creation of various tests, including:

- **End-to-end tests:** These tests assess the functionality of an entire application, ensuring that different components work seamlessly together.

- **Component tests:** Focused on individual components or modules, these tests verify the functionality and behavior of isolated parts of the application.

- **Integration tests:** These tests check the interactions and collaborations between different components, ensuring that they integrate smoothly.

- **Unit tests:** Concentrating on the smallest units of code, unit tests validate the correctness of individual functions or methods.

Cypress is capable of testing any element that operates within a web browser, making it a comprehensive solution for web development testing. Its flexibility and ability to cover a wide range of testing scenarios contribute to its popularity among those involved in building and maintaining modern web applications.

## Key Features of Cypress Testing

- Time Travel: Cypress captures snapshots during test execution.Hover over commands in the Command Log to inspect each step's details.

- Debuggability: Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Readable errors and stack traces facilitate quick debugging.

- Automatic Waiting: No need to add explicit waits or sleeps in tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before proceeding.

- Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. Offers functionality akin to unit testing for enhanced control.

- Network Traffic Control: Easily manage, stub, and test edge cases related to network traffic. Enables flexible control over network behavior without involving the server.

- Consistent Results: Cypress architecture, distinct from Selenium, ensures fast, consistent, and reliable tests. Minimizes flakiness and provides stable test results.

- Screenshots, Videos, and Test Replay: Automatically captures screenshots on failure. Record videos of the entire test suite for review. Test Replay in Cypress Cloud allows debugging with confidence.

- Cross Browser Testing: Supports running tests in Firefox, Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron). Ideal for local development and integration into Continuous Integration pipelines.

- Smart Orchestration: Easily parallelize test suites in Cypress Cloud. Spec Prioritization allows rerunning failed specs first. Auto Cancellation for tight feedback loops upon test failures.

- Flake Detection: Cypress Cloud includes Flaky test management.

Identify and diagnose unreliable tests for improved test suite reliability.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install Cypress, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Setting Up Cypress in Your React Project

Once Cypress is installed, open your project's root directory in the terminal.

Initialize Cypress by running the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will create a cypress directory with example test files.

## Writing Your First Test

Open the cypress/integration directory and create a new file, for example, example.spec.js.

In example.spec.js, write a simple test to check if your React app loads successfully:

```jsx
describe('My React App', () => {
  it('successfully loads', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000'); // Replace with your app's URL
  });
});
```

## Running Tests

To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

This will execute your Cypress tests in headless mode.

## Writing More Complex Tests

As you become familiar with Cypress, you can write more complex tests to interact with your React components. Cypress provides a clean and expressive syntax for interactions. For example:

```bash
describe('Login Functionality', () => {
  it('logs in successfully', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/login');

    // Interact with login form elements
    cy.get('[data-testid=username]').type('yourUsername');
    cy.get('[data-testid=password]').type('yourPassword');
    cy.get('[data-testid=login-button]').click();

    // Assert that login was successful
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.get('[data-testid=user-greeting]').should('contain', 'Welcome, yourUsername!');
  });
});
```

## Integrating with Continuous Integration (CI)

If you're using a CI service like Jenkins or [GitHub](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) Actions, you can integrate Cypress tests into your CI workflow. Modify your CI configuration to include a Cypress run command.

For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```github
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npx cypress run
```

You've set up and written your first Cypress tests for a React application. As you continue building your React project, you can expand and enhance your Cypress test suite to ensure the reliability of your application. Explore Cypress [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) for more advanced features and best practices.

## Command Line

Cypress provides a powerful command-line interface for executing tests, allowing you to integrate testing into your development workflow seamlessly. This guide covers essential commands, their options, and real-world examples to help you make the most of Cypress through the command line.

Before using the command-line interface, ensure you've installed Cypress by following the Installing Cypress guide.

## How to run commands

Cypress commands can be executed using various package managers:

Using `npx`:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

Using `Yarn`:

```bash
yarn cypress run
```

Using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm cypress run
```

You can also add the Cypress command to the `scripts` object in your `package.json` file and call it from an npm run script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cy:run": "cypress run"
  }
}
```

To run tests from a single spec file and record the results with Cypress Cloud, use:

```bash
npm run cy:run -- --record --spec "cypress/e2e/my-spec.cy.js"
```

Alternatively, you can invoke the locally installed Cypress tool directly:

```bash
npx cypress run --record --spec "cypress/e2e/my-spec.cy.js"
```

## Cypress Commands

## cypress run

Runs Cypress tests to completion. By default, `cypress run` will run all tests headlessly.

```bash
cypress run [options]
```

Options

`--auto-cancel-after-failures`: Overrides the Cloud project-level configuration to set the failed test threshold for auto cancellation or to disable auto cancellation when recording to the Cloud.

Example:

```bash
cypress run --record --key <<your_record_key>> --auto-cancel-after-failures 1
```

## Real World Example

The Cypress Real World App (RWA) uses the `--config` flag to specify viewport sizes for responsive testing locally and in dedicated CI jobs. Examples:

- npm scripts to run Cypress in mobile viewport.
- Circle CI job configuration for running test suites inmobile viewport.

```bash
cypress run --config
pageLoadTimeout=100000,watchForFileChanges=false
```

## cypress open

Opens Cypress.

```bash
cypress open [options]
```

Options

- `--browser`, `-b`: Run Cypress in the browser with the given name. If a filesystem path is supplied, Cypress will attempt to use the browser at that path.
- `--component`: Open in component testing mode.
- `--config`, `-c`: Specify configuration.
  Example:

```bash
cypress open --browser /usr/bin/chromium
```

## cypress info

Prints information about Cypress and the current environment.

```bash
cypress info
```

## cypress verify

Verify that Cypress is installed correctly and is executable.

```bash
cypress verify
```

## cypress version

Prints the installed Cypress binary version, the Cypress package version, the version of Electron used to build Cypress, and the bundled Node version.

```bash
cypress version
```

## cypress cache [command]
