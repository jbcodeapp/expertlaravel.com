## Introduction

## Dynamic Model Casting

Model Casts have transitioned from being defined as a property to being declared within a method named [casts()](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting). This change allows the utilization of static methods for built-in casters and the definition of static methods for custom casters. Here's an example:

```php
<?php

use App\Enums\UserOption;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEnumCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEncryptedCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEnumArrayObject;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class YourModel extends Model
{
    // Other model properties and methods...

    /**
     * Get the attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
            'password' => 'hashed',
            'options' => AsEnumCollection::of(UserOption::class),
        ];
    }

    // Example of using static methods for built-in casters
    public static function setCustomCasts()
    {
        AsCollection::using(OptionCollection::class);
        AsEncryptedCollection::using(OptionCollection::class);
        AsEnumArrayObject::using(OptionEnum::class);
        AsEnumCollection::using(OptionEnum::class);
    }
}

?>

```

## Laravel 10 In Dynamic Model Casting

In [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/releases), the equivalent cast definition without the ability to use static methods within an array property would look like this:

```php
<?php

use App\Enums\UserOption;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEnumCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class YourModel extends Model
{
    // Other model properties and methods...

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'options' => AsEnumCollection::class . ':' . UserOption::class,
    ];
}

?>

```

Notably, this update in [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/docs/master/releases) is backward-compatible with Laravel 10. You can continue defining casts using both the `$casts` property and the new `casts()` method. The method keys take precedence over the `$casts` property.

## Laravel 11 Model Casting New Static Method

Additionally, Laravel 11 introduces new static methods for built-in casters, facilitating the definition of casts. For instance:

```php
<?php

use App\Enums\UserOption;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEnumCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEncryptedCollection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsEnumArrayObject;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class YourModel extends Model
{
    // Other model properties and methods...

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'options' => AsEnumCollection::class . ':' . UserOption::class,
    ];

    /**
     * Get the attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
            'password' => 'hashed',
        ];
    }

    // Example of using static methods for built-in casters
    public static function setCustomCasts()
    {
        AsCollection::using(OptionCollection::class);
        AsEncryptedCollection::using(OptionCollection::class);
        AsEnumArrayObject::using(OptionEnum::class);
        AsEnumCollection::using(OptionEnum::class);
    }
}

?>

```

## Quick summary

Model Casts in Laravel 11 now transition from being defined as a property to a method named casts(). This change allows the use of static methods for built-in casters and enables the definition of static methods for custom casters. The update maintains backward compatibility with Laravel 10, supporting both the new method and the traditional $casts property for cast definitions.

## FAQs

### 1. Why the transition from property to method for Model Casts in Laravel 11?

> - The transition allows the use of static methods for both built-in and custom casters, providing more flexibility and clarity in cast definitions.

### 2. How does the new casts() method enhance cast definitions?

> - The casts() method allows for improved organization and readability by encapsulating cast definitions within a dedicated method.

### 3. Can I still use the $casts property in Laravel 11 for cast definitions?

> - Yes, Laravel 11 maintains backward compatibility, allowing developers to use both the $casts property and the new casts() method. Method keys take precedence over the $casts property.

### 4. What is the significance of the new static methods introduced in Laravel 11?

> - Laravel 11 introduces static methods like AsCollection::using() for built-in casters, making it easier to define casts using custom classes.

### 5. How does backward compatibility work for Model Casts in Laravel 11?

> - Laravel 11 ensures backward compatibility by supporting cast definitions through both the traditional $casts property and the new casts() method. Method keys take precedence in case of conflicts.
